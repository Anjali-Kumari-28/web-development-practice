              <h3><u>SPRING SEASON</u></h3>
              <p><b>Spring is the season that comes after winter and before summer.</b><br>
                 <strong>It occurs as a result of the warmth caused by the changing <i>position of the Earthâ€™s axis</i> relative to the Sun.</strong><br>
                <em>In the spring,</em> the weather becomes warmer and better.<br>
                 <small>The days become longer, </small> and night becomes shorter.<br><br>
                 In the spring,<mark>the snow starts to melt,</mark>and buds start to appear on trees and bushes.<br>
                 <del>In fact,</del>the melting of the<ins>snow is the first sign of spring.</ins> Plants start to grow new bright<sub> green leaves</sub>and<br>
                 <sup>colorful flowers</sup>.<br>
                   Moreover, animals wake up from hibernation, and birds return to their homes.<br>We often call spring the season of rebirth.
